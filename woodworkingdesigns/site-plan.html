        <h3>About the Designer page</h3>
        <p>
            Just a little bit about our designer, Blake Torres. He was born and raised in Texas. He values family and friend relationships. He is a 
            family man, and his greatest joy comes from being with his family. He first started working with wood projects in his early twenties as 
            he built little things for family and friends. He ultimately fell in love with woodworking from those early projects and has a great 
            passion still to this day for it. Blake has an eye for design and detail. He loves working with people and coming up with new and exciting
            projects to build and create. Blake's favorite projects and designs are the ones that bring families closer together, whether it is a 
            kitchen table or a beautiful custom picture frame, he loves the joy that these things bring to his customers and their families. When it 
            comes to woodworking, he values quality work and customer satisfaction above all else. Blake loves every step of woodworking. He can 
            often be found at his sawmill cutting up tree logs and turning them into workable slabs of lumber for his future projects. He states 
            that being involved from the earliest start allows him to admire what it is that he has designed and where it all started from. Seeing 
            a project from start to finish is something he will never tire of. He has great hopes that his love of woodworking and design will 
            influence those around him to want to do the same. Being able to build and create something beautiful out of nothing is a remarkable 
            feeling of accomplishment, and he wants to pass that excitement on to others so that they can experience the same feeling of 
            accomplishment that he does.
