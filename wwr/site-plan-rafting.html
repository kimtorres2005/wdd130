    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Our purpose is to expand our platform and be more visible and accessible to our customers. We want to
      give our customers the best experience possible with both our website and what we can offer in the water.
      By building a website for our company, we can reach not just more people, but also a wider variety of
      people. With this website, we can educate the public about white water safety, and give them the tools
      they need to have the best experience possible. We are a family-owned company and want to share that
      family dynamic with others.</p>
    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target customers are those that love the outdoors. This can include a wide range of people of all different
      ages and financial situations. These are people that want a great experience whenever they are in nature. We
      can meet those needs with our expertise and knowledge of white water rafting. Since our audience is not limited to
      age, we want to create a site that is desktop, laptop, and mobile-device friendly.</p>
